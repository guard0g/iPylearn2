Pylearn2 in iPython Tutorial without Tears

After my recent presentation at the Nashville Machine Learning meetup on Handwriting Recognition, it dawned on me that no resources exist for people to learn about how to use the Pylearn2 package within iPython to build and fine-tune neural networks without YAML. With that motivation, I've put together a set of beginning to advanced tutorials to explore the power of Pylearn2 and Theano for neural network computation. All comments and suggestions welcome.
