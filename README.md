Pylearn2 in iPython Tutorial without Tears

After a recent presentation I gave at the Nashville Machine Learning meetup, it dawned on me that no resources exist for people to learn about how to use the Pylearn2 package  build and tune neural networks in iPython without YAML. With that motivation, I'm putting together a set of beginning to advanced tutorials to explore the power of Pylearn2 and Theano for neural network computation. All comments and suggestions are welcome.
